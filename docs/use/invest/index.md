Also, [check out this video](https://youtu.be/5-s8AUdEHVk) to learn how to set up a parity signer and claim CFG rewards.

## Assess a pool

### Introduction

This section walks you through the process as an investor before the first investment: from the home page, to the pool page, and to the resources that will help you decide whether or not you are ready to invest in a pool. After this section, you should be able to do your own research (‚ÄúDYOR‚Äù) and confidently invest in one of the upcoming Tinlake pools.

### The TL;DR Checklist

It‚Äôs a lot of information at first, so we put together this step by step list you can use to help you make a decision about which pool you feel best investing in:

- Choosing a pool: Select the pool based on pool value, asset type, and DROP APR that you are most comfortable with.
- Asset Originator: check the Discourse community intro and pool summary, and any other information you find on the web about the company/asset. Check the list of assets financed on Tinlake to see their reputation on Tinlake.
- Asset Type: Do I understand what assets I will finance and the risk of this asset type?
- Risk: Am I comfortable with the TIN buffer protecting my DROP?
- Yield: How does the Cash drag look in relation to the average asset size?

### For starters: Choosing pools

We gotta start in the most obvious place: tinlake.centrifuge.io. The top banner shows you the total value for all pools but for our purposes, we are only looking at the list of pools which currently (mid January 2021) are:

![](./images/choosing_pools.png)

Each one of these is a pool run by an Asset Originator. This dashboard currently shows you a list of seven pools. You might notice that some of them have that little yellow label ‚Äùoversubscribed;‚Äù in the screenshot above these are amongst others Harbor Trade Credit, ConsolFreight and Paperchain. That yellow label means that they are currently not open for additional investments. When these asset originators drop more assets to be financed the pool will open back up and the label will disappear.

Under the Asset Originator, you‚Äôll find the asset type. For New Silver, it‚Äôs real estate bridge loans. That means you, as the investor, will be financing New Silver‚Äôs active real estate bridge loans. As an investor you finance the entire portfolio, so you finance all loans in the pool, not one single asset. You can actually see the bridge loans converted to NFTs on the Assets page (will go more into that later).

The Pool Value tells you the current volume of financed assets and how big the pool currently is.

The DROP APR is the fixed nominal interest rate DROP investors receive. This rate is applied to the outstanding financing amount of the pool and tells you how much profit you should expect for your invested DAI. The interest in Tinlake (as most DeFi protocols) is accrued every second, so you earn yield every moment you are invested. That means if you invest 10k DAI into a fully deployed Tinlake pool with a 10% DROP APR you will have 11.05k at the end of the year (equal to a 10.52% APY). The effective DROP yield may be slightly lower than the DROP APR due to the pool‚Äôs ‚Äúcash drag‚Äù (see below). Also, when you invest, you also receive Radial Rewards on top ü§ë.

### Check out Asset Originator and Asset Type

Based on the asset type, let‚Äôs say you are most interested in real estate bridge loans. You understand the asset and feel more comfortable with a 5% DROP APR, given your trust in real estate. The Pool Overview tab will be your first resource that helps you check out the Asset Originator. Let‚Äôs start below, where you‚Äôll find a short introduction to the Asset Originator and the asset type.
In the header you'll find the most important metrics for this pool: Asset type, Asset maturity, DROP APR and Pool Value.
![](./images/pool_info.png)

The asset maturity tells you how liquid your investment may be. The maturity date of every financing lets you know when the asset originator is obliged to pay back the loan. Upon repayment investors will always be able to redeem before an Asset Originator can use the funds for new financings again. Thus you can see the average maturity as a ‚Äúsoft lockup‚Äù period. The reason it is ‚Äúsoft‚Äù is because you technically still can withdraw funds from the pool reserve, if the pool reserve has money to draw or other investors want to invest into the pool.

Under Asset Originator Details you find information about the Asset Originator and links to more resources.
![](./images/asset_originator_details.png)

### Discourse: Learn More about the Asset Originator

If you want to dig deeper into the Asset Originator you‚Äôll find more information about the company spinning a pool in the Centrifuge Discourse. There is a link at the end of the description, clicking that link will send you to the New Silver‚Äôs community intro.

![](./images/new_silver_intro.png)

This is a human-friendly page that answers more about the company, organization, asset details, and disclosures. A list of all the community intros can be found here.
At the beginning of the community intro, you‚Äôll find the pool summary (above it‚Äôs NS Series 2). This is a detailed description of the actual pool. On both the community intro and pool summary, you are free to ask questions/express concerns directly to the asset originator. Here‚Äôs a list of all previous and current pool summaries.
Asset Maturity Date

### Gauging Reputation

If you want to take a look at the past and current financings of the pool, change to the ‚ÄúAsset‚Äù tab, which will give you a list of the asset originator‚Äôs history with Tinlake as well as the graph of the development of asset value and reserve. For all assets in the list, a status of "NFT locked" (so the NFT is locked as collateral but not financed yet) ‚ÄúOngoing‚Äù or ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù (fully repaid) will be listed.

![](./images/pool_financings.png)

Note: it‚Äôs good to also be aware that we have just recently launched Tinlake. Many of these pools are still building up their asset history. ConsolFreight, whose invoice sizes are much smaller, is a good example showing a solid reputation history.

### Maximum Pool Reserve

You may also notice the ‚ÄúMax: 1‚Äù under the Pool Reserve. The maximum Reserve can be set by the Asset Originator and signal its financing needs. Subtracting the Max pool reserve by the current pool reserve will let you know how much you can invest in a pool. If the current Reserve is higher than the maximum Reserve set by the Asset Originator the pool is ‚Äúoversubscribed.‚Äù So for New Silver, the pool is currently "oversubscribed", thus no further funding through investments is required.

### Sizing up the Pool by the Numbers: Risk and Yield

Once you are happy with the Asset Originator, let‚Äôs look at the state of the pool at the bottom of the Overview page. Lots of numbers happening here. But if it‚Äôs your first time, here are the most important things you need to know to better understand how the pool is doing:

![](./images/pool_state.png)

### Pool Value, Asset Value, and ‚ÄúCash drag‚Äù

The left side gives you a summary of the pool‚Äôs asset portfolio. It shows you how many financings currently are active as well as the current maturity and value of these assets. The card also tells you how much liquidity is in the pool‚Äôs ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù. The Pool Reserve and Asset Value add up to the Pool Value. The pool reserve is idle money: that means its money not being used to finance an asset. It‚Äôs normally more healthy to see this number relatively low compared to the Average Loan Size because investors don‚Äôt earn yield on the reserve ‚Äî only on outstanding investments. Thus, a persistently high pool reserve may drag down your effective yield (‚Äúcash drag‚Äù). Temporarily, a Reserve may be relatively high. So for example, New Silver‚Äôs assets are quite big. Each real estate loan is around 190k. That means they will need at least 190k in the pool Reserve to finance the next asset.

### TIN and DROP and the Minimum TIN Risk buffer

The two cards to the right show you the current value of each of the two tranches (note, that both values add up to the ‚ÄúPool Value‚Äù of the asset side). The value of these two tranches define the ‚ÄúCurrent TIN risk buffer‚Äù, calculated as TIN value / Pool Value, which you find between the tranche cards. This metric lets DROP investors know how protected they are through TIN. In this pool, the minimum is 15%, meaning DROP holders are protected even if 15% of the loans default. TIN holders (the higher risk) will take that loss instead. The ratio shows currently that it‚Äôs at 28%, meaning that percentage has risen. This number can fluctuate but the pool will never allow it to go below 15%. Note: If you need a refresher on how our TIN + DROP system works, head [here](link to two tranches section).

## Onboarding Guide

### Introduction

Tinlake pools are backed by real-world assets such as invoices, residential real-estate loans or trade receivables. Financing those assets on Tinlake requires a legal structure that give the investors a legal claim on the assets. To ensure this recourse, each Asset Originator sets up a legal structure commonly used in the traditional financial system - a ‚Äúspecial purpose vehicle‚Äù ("SPV"). The collateral for the individual assets are assigned to this legal entity to ensure investors have a legal claim to the underlying assets and the assets are held independently ("banktruptcy remote") from the Asset Originator.

### Why onboarding and KYC

With such an underlying legal structure, investments in Tinlake Pool's usually are private placements from a regulatory perspective. This comes with certain regulatory requirements For example, behind many Tinlake pools are SPVs incorporated in Delaware. Private placements from these SPVs are conducted under `Reg D` or `Reg S` of the [`US Securities Act of 1933`](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1884/pdf/COMPS-1884.pdf) which means US investors must be accredited and all investors must clear standard KYC ("Know Your Customer") checks. All investors must also sign a subscription agreement ("SubDoc") with the pools "Issuer", so the legal entity/SPV behind the pool.

This legal set-up leads to certain restrictions. For example, there usually is a minimum investment amount per pool, US investors have to be `Accredited Investors` and, unfortunately, investors from certain countries may be excluded due to sanctions or missing tax treaties.

This obviously contradicts the idea of decentralized and open finance and the Centrifuge team is working hard to allow more people to invest within the legal framework given by regulators.

### Onboarding quick guide

To adhere to the regulatory requirements, Tinlake has integrated Securitize.io and Docusign for an automated KYC and SubDoc signing process.

![](./images/onboarding_guide.png)

After you have connected the ETH account you want to use for the investment into a Tinlake pool, there are three main steps to complete the onboarding (see further below for a more detailed step-by-step guide):

**1) Link your Securitize account**

First you need to link a newly created or existing Securitize account to your connected Ethereum address. This is a one-time step and you will be redirected to Tinlake to continue onboarding.

**2) Complete KYC through Securitize**

In the next step you will be forwarded to Securitize again for KYC so Securitize can verify your identity and investor status if you are an US resident.
To complete KYC, Securitize will usually ask you to provide:

- A government issued photo ID or passport
- [Optional] A selfie with this government issued photo ID
- Proof of address, e.g. utility bill, phone bill or council tax bill, not older than 3 months

Securitize's automated KYC process is usally conducted within one hour. If a manual review is required it may take 24h-48h.

Note, that this is a only one time step to become an eligible investor for Tinlake. Thus, you can reuse your KYCed Securitize iD for all Tinlake pools.

**3) Sign Subscription Agreement**

The final step is to digitally sign the subscription agreement with the pool's Issuer through Docusign. Please read the subscription agreement and attached executive summary carefully and sign it fill in your data. Depending on your country of tax residency you may also be required to fill out additional tax forms.
Your completed and signed document will be automatically shared with the pools issuer. After the Issuer has counter-signed **and** your KYC has cleared your ETH address will be whitelisted for investment and you are ready to go.

Note that, that this only has to be done once for every pool. This means, that once you have signed the subdoc with the issuer you can freely invest and redeem in this pool.

### FAQ

##### What is the minimum investment amount?

The minimum investment amount is determined by the pools issuer. It currently is \$5.000 for all Tinlake pools.

##### What documents/information do I need to provide for KYC?

To complete KYC, Securitize will ask you to provide

- A government issued photo ID or passport
- [Optionally] A selfie with this government issued photo ID
- Proof of address, e.g. utility bill, phone bill or council tax bill, usually not older than 3 months

##### How long does KYC take?

Securitize's automated KYC process is usally conducted within 1-2h. If a manual review is required it may take 24h-48h.

##### What is an "Accredited Investor"?

An accredited investor is an individual or a business entity that is allowed to trade securities that may not be registered with financial authorities such as the SEC. They are entitled to this privileged access by satisfying certain requirements regarding their income, net worth, asset size, governance status or professional experience. In the U.S, the definition of an accredited investor is put forth by [SEC in Rule 501 of Regulation D](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=8edfd12967d69c024485029d968ee737&r=SECTION&n=17y3.0.1.1.12.0.46.176).

The regulations for accredited investors vary from between jurisdictions but usually require that a person:

- must have a certain annual income [currently $200,000 ($300,000 for joint income) in the US] or
- must have a certain net worth [currently $1 million in the US] or
- be a general partner, executive officer, or director for the company that is issuing the unregistered securities or
- be a registered brokers and investment advisor

Please find more information [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp) and [here](https://support.investready.com/help/verification-requirements-on-investready).

##### What information do I need to provide as accredited investor?

If you are an US investor you further need to provide documentation to prove you are an `Accredited Investor`. These documents can be, e.g.:

- IRS documents such as 1040s, W2s, 1099s, or K1s as proof of income
- Documents proving a net worth of at least \$1MM USD excluding the primary residence value not older than 90 days
- Third party letters signed by a licensed CPA, attorney, broker-dealer or registered investment advisor

Please find more details of required and accepted documents within Securitize.

##### What happens with my data

All investors must consent to share their personal data, such as name, address and country of residents with Securitize, Centrifuge and the pool's issuer. This data will be disclosed to Securitize during the onboarding process. Securitize may also share this data with the pool's issuer and Centrifuge.

## Investment Guide

### Investment requirements

#### Legal requirements

- Onboarding incl. KYC through [Securitize.io](https://centrifuge.invest.securitize.io/#/login) has been succesfully completed
- Legal documentation (`Subscription Agreement`) for the pool you want to invest in has been signed in Securitize.io

![](./images/onboarding_flow.png#width=600px)

#### Technical requirements

- A web browser with a web3 wallet. Tinlake supports Ledger, [Metamask](https://metamask.io) and [Portis](https://www.portis.io/) at the moment. If you have not installed a web3 wallet yet, we recommend to use Metamask. This guide will also focus on using Tinlake with Metamask as a [Browser plugin](https://metamask.io/download.html). Please apply approporiate security measures when setting up your web3 wallet(see also below).
- _**If you use a Ledger, please make sure to activate `Contract data` in the settings of the Ethereum app and to update to the latest firmware.**_
- You need use the Ethereum address you have specified in the Subscription Agreement through your web3 wallet
- The "Ethereum Address of the Subscriber" needs to hold the DAI you want to invest

#### Display DAI and TIN/DROP in Metamsk

By default, Metamask only displays your ETH balance under `Assets`. Other tokens need to be added to be displayed. To display the DAI and DROP balances in Metamask, you need to add both tokens to Metamask.
For DROP and TIN this can be done through Tinlake UI. Just click on `Add DROP/TIN to your wallet` in the respective investment component (see below) and confirm in Metamask.
If you haven't added DAI yet, in Metamask:

- Click on `Assets` tab
- Scroll down, click on `Add token`
- Look for `DAI` in the search field
- Mark `Dai Stablecoin (DAI)`
- Scroll down and click on `Next`
- Add `DAI` with a click on the `Add tokens` button

### Fund your Ethereum address

Please make sure that your Ethereum address is funded with the investment amount in DAI and sufficient ETH to pay for the transactions. There are [several centralized and decentralized exchanges](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/how-to-buy-ethereum), such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) where you can buy and/or trade ETH and DAI against USD and other tokens.

### The investment interface

The investment will be made through the Tinlake UI available at [tinlake.centrifuge.io](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/). Select the pool you want to invest in and connect your web3 wallet.
At the top of the page you find the most important pool information, such as the current Pool and Tranche values ([more on Tranches](../../overview/tranches/) and other on Tinlake terminology.)

![](./images/pool_overview.png)

Below you find the current epoch state to your left and the TIN/DROP invest and redeem components to your right:

![](./images/epoch_details.png)

Under `Current epoch` you can see how much time and investment capacity is left in the current epoch. You can lock your investment/redemption at any time during an epoch. After the minimum epoch duration has passed, the epoch can be closed and all locked orders will be executed following a best effort approach. The table under `Total locked orders` shows you how many TIN/DROP investment and redemption order are locked for the current epoch.

### Investment flow summary

Tinlake's investment's and redemptions are executed in (usually daily ) epochs. During the epoch you can lock your investment or redemption order. You can cancel your locked order at any time throughout the epoch. At the end of the epoch all locked orders automatically executed at best effort considering investment/redemption supply and demand and the pools risk metrics. You can collect your TIN/DROP (in case of an investment) or DAI (in case of an redemption) token at any time following the start of the new epoch. If your order is only partially executed you can collect the executed order. The unfullfilled part of the order remains locked for investment/redemption but can this lock can be cancelled at any time.

![](./images/investment_flow.png#width=600px)

### Step-by-step investment guide

#### Connect to Tinlake pool

- Go to the [Tinlake URL](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) in your browser
- Click on the pool you want to invest in in the list of pools or visit it directly with the provided pool URL. You will see the pool details.
- Select the Ethereum address used for investing in Metamask. Make sure you also select the `Main Ethereum Network` as network.
- Click on the `Connect` button in the top right corner to connect your Ethereum address for the use with Tinlake. Confirm that you want to connect with your Metamask wallet.
- You should now see your address at the top right
  ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/centrifuge-hackmd/upload_676dff1fce8625342cb4eefa1be49b70.png)
- Click on the `Investments` tab.

#### Lock your investment

You find the TIN/DROP investment and redemption components on the investment page of the pool.

![](./images/drop_modal.png#width=400px)

When you are connected with your whitelisted address after succesfully going through KYC and signing the Subsription Agreement on Securitize, your component will give you the Option to Invest and Redeem

![](./images/drop_modal_whitelisted.png#width=400px)

Before you start investing, you may want to `Add TIN/DROP token to your wallet` by simply clicking on the link at the bottom of the component.

To lock your TIN/DROP investment:

- Click on the `Invest` button
- Input the amount in DAI you want to invest (Note, that the Tinlake Minimum Investment amount is 10,000 DAI)
- Click on `Lock DAI`

![](./images/drop_modal_invest.png#width=400px)

- This will open Metamask to confirm the transaction
  - If you are using Metamask without a hardware wallet there will one transaction to confirm
  - If you are using a hardware wallet there will be two transactions to confirm at your first transaction (First `Token Approval` then the `Invest Order`). For all your folling investments there will only be one confirmation in Metamask
- Your sucessfully locked order will be displayed in the component

![](./images/drop_modal_order.png#width=400px)

- Your investment amount in DAI will be transferred from your wallet and locked in the Tinlake contracts

**Note that locked DAI are not invested in Tinlake yet and thus do not accrue interest. Your order will be automatically executed at best effort at the close of the epoch.**

#### Cancel your locked investment

You can cancel your locked invest order at any time during the epoch. To cancel a locked order:

- Click on the `Cancel Order` button
- Confirm that you want to cancel

![](./images/drop_modal_cancel.png#width=400px)

- This will open Metamask where you need to confirm the cancel transaction

#### Epoch close and order execution

When the epoch is closed all locked orders will be executed by the smart contracts at best effort considering the pools risk metrics. E.g. if the current TIN risk buffer is already close to the Minimum TIN risk buffer no further DROP investments may be accepted until further TIN investments are provided. If the amount of locked orders exceed the epoch's `Maximum Investment Capacity` set by the Asset Originator, locked orders can only be partially executed pro rata.

#### Collect your executed investment

After all orders are executed your fullfilled TIN/DROP order will be ready for collection:

![](./images/drop_modal_collect.png#width=400px)

To collect your TIN/DROP token simply

- Click on the `Collect button`
  The TIN/DROP token will be transferred to your wallet.
